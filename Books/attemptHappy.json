Personally I don't much care about other people's expectations, but it hurts seeing people I care about beat themself up because of others expectations. Some of the people beat themselfs up over their own expectations that the create because of what the people around them say and think.Don't get me wrong. self improvement is a good thing, but even to much of a good thing can be bad. One great example is this one girl I know. Stunning eyes, beautiful dark brown hair, a smile that can cure even the deepest pains. I never thought someone could be beautiful,stunning, lovely, striking, magnificent, enchanting, dazzling and breathtaking all at once. She will argue with what I just said, I only wish I could let her see herself through my eyes. Unfortunetly I can't do this, and because of something in the past she believes she is not worth being themain character in her story. And I wish I could show her that she has no reason to feel this way. She is better than perfect in every single way. I quite frankly don't know how the other guys keep their jaws from dropping to the floor at the sight of her pure beauty."

    "content": "So you had a bad day. I truely wished that you never had to see this book. It will come as no surprise that I have no idea what might have happend. So I will do my best to address some of the main things that could go wrong. If you don't feel the best about your looks, just remeber that from everyone he chose you. The guy who could get any girl that he wants chose you. This is because of two main reasons. Don't make a mistake there are many more, but these one's stand out. Firstly it's your stunning personality. Secondly it's your unparraleled beauty. No one can come close to you. I wish you could see yourself through our eyes, because clearly your mirror lies to you. There is no one on this green earth that comes close to your heavenly beauty, don't let anyone dare tell you otherwise. If you feel down because you feel like you ate too much, firstly you don't eat to much. In fact you don't eat enough. You compare yourself to us. Don't there's a reason woman live longer than men. We eat way to little. This is a clasic demonstration of judging a fish by it's ability to climb a tree. Youre way to hard on yourself. And it concerns me. Please don't compare yourself to us. We stupid. Like really really stupid. And I know for a fact you ain't stupid. So please don't starve yourself just because we do it. It isn't good for you. If he hurts you, first things first. I'm sorry, really I am. You don't deserve it."

They have the ability to make you feel like your in Heaven or the can rip your hart out. Beleiving that you deserve to be treated badly is so wrong.This girl I know believes it's what she deserves. She believes that in order for her to get through a day she has to get hurt. Worst still is that her person is hurting her like this. She is such a pretty specimen. She deserves to be treated like a princess. Because of a rough past she believes she deserves to get hurt. This is so not true. She deserves nothing but the best. She deserves to have the world layed at her feet. It's true that being hurt makes you stronger, but one can only be hurt so much. And she is already stronger than most. So she of all people doesn't deserve the pain. She has a heart of gold, no one can deny that. If only I could explain to that man how much he is hurting her I'm sure he will stop. It's clear he doesn't know what a gem he poses. And explaining to him he is destroying it will make him stop. For he cares deeply about her and will do anything to avoid hurting her."

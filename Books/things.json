She asked me what to do, for the past week I thought everything was going great. So in my mind she was going to be ok. He stopped pushing her. He started being decent. Oh boy do I wish this was the case. She asked me what to do, I told her I had been wondering the same thing. Honestly the way I see it there are 2 choices. Stay and run the risk of him being a horny gorilla. Leave and run the risk of staying single. Neither of those are good. Pushing someone past their boundaries for your personal gain is as low as it gets. Being single ain't much better tho. Because there is nobody like him to go to if she leaves him. Sure I will be there to help, but a friend doesn't mean as much as a lover. All I can do is try to help, but that isn't the same as having someone in whose arms you can feel safe in."

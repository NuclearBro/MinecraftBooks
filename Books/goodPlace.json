I thought moving on would be easier. Truth is it still hurts. I thought I made peace with the fact that I am going to go through life alone clearly I haven't. Sure I hide the pain, I hide the lonelyness. Truth is outside I'm smiling but inside I'm dying. Slowly sinking into the dark. Oh well as long as no one sees it everything will be fine. This is why I don't open up. It hurts and most people don't really care. Others pretend to care and then just leave."

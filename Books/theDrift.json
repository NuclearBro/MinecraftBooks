I know for a fact that it would have started then. But what the hell, what does it matter if it happend 2 weeks earlier. Usually it gradualy starts, but this time it was sudden. Oh well it's for the better. At least she feels better. At least she doesn't need me anymore. She is strong, smart and beuatiful. She will be fine. She will manage. My job is done I guess. I just hope things work out for her."

The second being that it could hurt you. So now I am busy losing your trust, faith and most importantly you all because I can't bare the thought of hurting you. It might seem that breaking my promises come easy. I wish that was the fact. Every time I break a promise my heart skips a beat. I've never felt as bad in my entire life as I do after breaking a promise. In the end it's worth it tho. So if I loose myself and everyone that I hold near and dear to my broken heart just so that I have to avoid hurting them, I will. This is a sacrifice that no one else should have to make. So in order to try and spare others I lay myself bare to the emotional and physical pain caused bybreaking my promises. Not sleeping, throwing up all night, unstoppable shivers and the empty feeling are all common symptoms I experience when I break a promise. But in the end it has to be done. Not for my own good but the people that actually matter to me."

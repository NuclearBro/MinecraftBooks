I also remember Sunday May 8th, I made a joke and you shed a tear because that was the first time that day you felt something besides depressed.  When I heard that I panicked and I knew I had to do something, so we went to the movies. Although I suggested we go to the movies to cheer you up I also kind of needed a hug or something to cheer me up. I was hoping you would give me a hug when we met up, but you didn’t -don’t feel bad though- at least I kinda got one when we said goodbye. I'm sorry thats selfish I know. I hate that pain and cold has to be something that you feel is a part of you, and I know it is a hard thing to fix, but I want to try, I have to try.  But I also don’t want to be another person that rips out 200% of your soul and leave you in such immense pain to deal with alone.  That would go against everything I’m trying to do. “If you’re always there for her, she won’t realise what you mean to her” well… that’s not true.  You mean a lot to me, more than you think, more than you give yourself credit for. You keep saying you’re dispensable, but you’re not, you really truly mean a lot to me. “You’re doing most of the work while not having the luxury of being in the relationship” I’m sorry I don’t want you to feel this way I’m trying to make the time and effort you spend worth, but I’m sorry if I have failed to that."

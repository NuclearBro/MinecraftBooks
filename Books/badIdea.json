    "content": "Moving on, always easier said than done. Having to pick up all the feelings, regrets and memories just to try and move on. My method, rather than try and move on with all the emotions I try and detach myself bit by bit. This way you don't break down yourself entirely, but rather peace by    peace. Losing only bits of yourself along the journey of moving on is a lot easier to cope with than having your heart ripped out all at once. The only problem with my method is that when ever I get hurt I close down. I loose myself in sad music. Hide all my emotions and just put on a smile and say everything is ok. It might seem that everything is fine. I seem happy, I laugh alot. But the truth is that Deep down I know I'm hurting, and that fact I can only hide from myself for so long. O well as long as no one sees the pain everything will be alright. Unfortunetly for me I met this one person who sees through all my layers. I struggle to hide anything from this person. But the more I get to know this person the worse I feel knowing that they have to deal with all my problems, when they have their own problems far worse then mine. And although opening up feels good. I can't continue to use this person for my own gain. Maybe one day I will tell them all my secrets, all my little quirks, every small detail about me, but that is but only a dream."

Well I tried my best, but I don't mean anything. I opened up, don't know why. She has her own problems. She doesn't need to hear about my troubles. Oh well the drift has begun, doesn't matter what I did. I know what comes next. I know all to well. She turns into a stranger with all my secrets. Don't make a mistake by thinking I am going to stop being there for her. I don't stop caring or helping. I just make sure not to hold them down with my problems. You had your chance, you blew it. This is your own fault. She deserves better. I only hope someone can give it to her, because clearly I can't."

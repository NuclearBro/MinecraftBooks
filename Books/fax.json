    "content": "Feeling dead inside. Tried it for most of my life. Was working well up until the end of last year. Met a girl, made a mistake, got hurt. From then on I have become a lot more suciptable to emotions. Tried hiding it again. Failed miserably again. Met someone who I can care for and try to help. She has a sweet smile, loving energy and she is one of the most fun people I know. There is never a dull moment with her. I truely can't remeber the last time feeling this happy. I tried to hide things from her, but I'm past that. I trust her to know my deepest secrets. Truth be told the thought of suicide has been on my mind a lot lately. Don't ask me why. It would just pop up, make me feel sad and depressed, and than as quick as it appeared it would be gone. One of the things I do to help me over come the bad urges is to sit back and think back to some of my favourite memories. Can't remember the last time that she wasn't in of my memories. Sure I could get hurt opening up, but you know what. I don't care if it hurts she is so much more important to me than just feeling bad for a bit. Sure I listen to sad music, but thereason for it is that after the pain caused by the song there are only good memories. Basically one could say I'm addicted to being hurt, truth is I'm addicted to what comes after the pain. As some might say, I find the end of the rainbow each time that happends. Dam, don't I wish I could express to her how I truely feel. All in good time I guess. Maybe, just maybe I write a book explaining how I truely feel. Truth is now might not be the best time, then again when will it be the best time. Thinking about it, as long as she is happy. I will be as well. She truely means the world to me"

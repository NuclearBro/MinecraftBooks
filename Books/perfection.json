Not that words can come close to describe all her complexities. Dark brown hair, like a forest floor that comforts you. Deep brown eyes that anyone can get lost in Then there is the smile, the infamous smile that can melt worlds and fix any problem. But don't let it fool you she can stand her ground and defend her own. From the neck down everything is just as perfect as her breathtaking face. As stated before, don't let her looks fool you.She is more than capable of putting anybody in their place. She has a fierce fighting spirit, but also a soft and gentle heart. She's smart as whip too. If you ever get on her bad side, my advice will be to run. Not that that would help. She's relentless and quiting isn't a word in her disctionary. Trying to fight won't help either as she is battle hardend and always ready for a fight. If she stands with you you will be unstopable, but if she stands against you be prepared for all hell to break loose."

Wanted to be secretive and what did I achieve? Nothing but push her away. It's too late to try and get her back. Not a milion words can bring her back. I know, because I tried. Neither can a milion tears bring her back. I know, because I cried. I owe her a massive apology. I have a idea that I think is pretty sweat. Unfortunately the timing is difficult. I will have to wait a while. What are the plans going forward? Try to help, not really much more that I can do. This is my own fault. I should have just opened up from the begining. But no I hade to try and play hard to get. Boy I'm stupid. Took her trust for granted, took her care for granted, took her for granted. Only now do I really realize how truely great she is. But like I said. I blew it. I thought about fading away. Why ? Maybe to avoid getting hurt. Now I realize that is so selfish. So I made a promise to myself. No matter the pain, I won't leave. Truth be told it's easier now that I made piece with what I am to her. Always thought that I would be the guy who makes her happy. Be the one to put the world on a plate for her. Oh well I blew my chances. She is searching for someone else. I pray to God she finds someone who is worthy of her love. She deserves only the best of the best, nothing less. And don't let me hear anything else. After everything she does for everyone around her she deserves to be treated like gold."

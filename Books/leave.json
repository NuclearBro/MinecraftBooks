I already know the facts. That's why I never dare to say any of these to her.When I hear her cry I wish I could just give her a hug, roll her up in a blanket, like a sushi roll. Place her on a comfortable place. Gather her favourite snacks. Put on her favourite movie. Just sit beside this cute little sushi roll. Feeding her snacks and making sure she is ok. It'sactually with tears in my eyes and a heavy heart that I admit this is never going to happen. Why would it? I got to invested and now it hurts to try and move on. Recently wrote a book about going out with Maryke. As nice as she is, she is not the same. I know It's fucked saying that. Maybe it's better to just end it all. Why even bother trying. I know it's never going to happen. I tried, I know that I mean nothing to her. Be that as it may, I will still fight with every ounce of my being to make her happy. Guess I am just a huge fucking simp. How pathetic. You don't deserve to be alive. Just go. Everyone will be better of without you. Book those plane tickets and just leave. No one is going to miss you. You already messed up their lives, it's time to leave. You have that list of possible jobs in America. Just go. You were so close to leaving. Put in your earphones, turn off your data, drive to the airport. It's as simple as that. Leave all the emotions behind. Come back some time, see that Dian got the girl he liked. Simone' worked everything out. Arno almost done with uni. Niel still as naughty as always. Dad will be in a happy place. Mom might have even achieved the impossible and maried again. Uncle will be done with the satisfactory world. Then just as sudden as you appeard you have to dissapear again. Just to make sure you don't ruin anything."

Wish I knew what was wrong. Wish I could have told her that I just needed someone to talk to. But I made a promise, there is one condition that keeps me from telling her when I don't feel like myself. She was busy enjoying her time with him, honestly I'm glad that things are looking up. So following the rules I set for my self I decided to leave her be. She hasn't spent much time with him lately so it's my responsibility to grant her some quality time with him. Anyway I need a place to vent so here I am. I don't know what is wrong. I can't eat, sleep or think. I find myself sinking back into a very deep hole. I know that I can't sink to deep or else I might not come back again. "

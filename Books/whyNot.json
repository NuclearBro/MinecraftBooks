Waking up every morning with your heart bearly beating just isn't for me. Thought about going with Maryke to do something. Not that I really know what to go and do.  It's nice that she and I share som similarities like both of us being acquainted with the farm life. Boring as it may be we both know how it works and the ammount of work that goes into it. Then again other that that we don't have to much in common. If i didn't misread the situation I think that she likes me. Then again I don't know if I like her in the same way. She is an good friend and it was nice getting to know her better in matric. Who knows maybe things work out. Just don't want to get hurt."

I only remeber little bits here and there. Just now a big chunk of the memories came back. It must have been her voice. The dissapointment in it must have been what brought back my memories. Why don't I remeber anything that happend this year. Well a few weeks ago I crashed my bike. And unlike the begining of the year this one was serious. I'm still repairing my bike. The scars have began to dissapear. The bruised ribs are also getting better. And like I Just said the memories are starting to come back. I havent told anyone about my accident, because I will most likely lose my bike if they find out. Back to the memory thing. I remember the ride, and the bike tipping over. The last thought through my mind was: is this it?"
